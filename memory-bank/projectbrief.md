# Project Brief

## Project Overview
RecordFlow is a Vue.js-based Progressive Web App designed specifically for teachers to manage educational records. It provides an offline-capable interface for handling nested educational data structures (grade levels > subjects > classes > class records). The project uses Vue 3 with the Composition API, along with Vite as the build tool and TailwindCSS for styling.

## Data Structure
- Grade Levels (top level)
  - Subjects (nested under grade levels)
    - Classes (nested under subjects)
      - Class Records (nested under classes)

## Access Model
Simple teacher-focused access without RBAC:
- Single-user focus for individual teachers
- Personal record management
- Local-first data with cloud sync

## Core Requirements
- Teacher-focused record management interface
- Hierarchical data navigation (grade > subject > class > records)
- Offline-first functionality for unreliable connections
- Local-first data storage with cloud synchronization
- Modern, responsive user interface
- Component-based architecture using Vue 3
- Efficient routing system using Vue Router
- State management with Pinia
- Reusable UI components with ShadCN Vue
- TailwindCSS for utility-first styling
- Fast development experience with Vite
